Our project has a smart container that triggers on low load to inform the supplier that replenishment is to be done. The supplier keeps track and initiates a delivery to home from registered retailer (denoted as LEds lighting up to home from Retailer), or initiating a van dispatch from regional distributor to retailer if adequate demand generated. 
Also in turn if distributor goes short of supply, the supplier factory initiates delivery of truck from factory to distributor. 

The project is implemented using Edison board in the Smart container(s) and Arduino boards and MQTT and enableiot for co-ordinated communication and tracking.
